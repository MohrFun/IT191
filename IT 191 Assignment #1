	In the information technology world, certifications and experience are everything. Coming right out of college it is hard to have the experience that the employer wants. Many jobs require 5 or more years in very specific areas. If you use the extra time you have in college to study for professional certifications, you will be way ahead of the game. Many people get hired for an entry level position and after working there for a while they realize they want to move up but can’t because they don’t have the proper certifications. 
	The job listings that I found that would be considered jobs I would want immediately after graduating ISU I already meet many of the qualifications. There are a few things I would need training on but would not be difficult. Going through the programs at Illinois Central College that I did prepared be for these jobs. One of the jobs is a help desk job that only requires and associates degree. Another is a network design engineer. I already have many of the skills that prefer because of my Cisco classes but after graduating ISU I would be extremely prepared for this job. The last one that I would want immediately after graduating is an IT assistant. I would be over qualified but it would be a solid starting job.

	In five to eight years, I see myself working towards either the Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert certification or working towards becoming a White hat. The first link is a supervisor job but requires 5-7 years of information technology security. The only way to gain experience is to start at the bottom of the totem pole and work your way up. I had a job as an IT assistant at a library and the real world production atmosphere is a lot different that learning something from a textbook. The next job is a network engineer job. Being a network engineer you have to know many different things. This company prefers a CCNP or CCIE certification. I already took all of the CCNP classes and now all I have to do is take the test. I see myself taking the test in the year 2016. The third job is considered a systems engineer. This job requires network engineer experience, network architect experience and much more. All of the requirements would be met while working my way up from the bottom.
